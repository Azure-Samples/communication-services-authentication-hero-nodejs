## 6. Submit a PR

* On your local working branch (previously forked from main), commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* Push your fork to GitHub
* In GitHub, create a pull request
* If the reviewers suggest changes then:
  - Make the required updates in your local branch
  - Rebase from main after fetching the lastest version and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git fecth
    git rebase origin/main
    git push -f
    ```
Once all comments are resolved and your PR is approved (by at least 2 reviewers), you can merge it.

And voilà! Thank you for your contribution!
